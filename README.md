## 🧠 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Retail Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis** built on a dataset of **3,900 customer records**.  
It uncovers **what drives sales, customer loyalty, and revenue concentration** through data cleaning, SQL analytics, and Power BI visualization.

The analysis follows a complete **Data → Insight → Action** pipeline:
1. **Data Preparation & Modeling (Python)**
2. **Exploratory Analysis (SQL)**
3. **Visualization & Insight Generation (Power BI)**
4. **Report & Presentation (Word / PowerPoint)**
5. **Documentation (GitHub Repository)**

---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand **customer purchasing behavior** and segment them by value.
- Identify **key business drivers** such as loyalty, subscriptions, and discounts.
- Deliver **data-driven recommendations** to improve sales and retention.
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with a "Neon Glow" theme.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview
A **4-page interactive “Neon Glow” dashboard** was created to tell a complete, data-driven story.

### **Page 1 – Sales Overview (The “What”)**
*Shows high-level business performance — what’s selling, when, and to whom.*

---

### **Page 2 – Key Drivers (The “Why”)**
*Analyzes the factors driving sales and loyalty, comparing subscriptions vs discounts.*

### **Page 3 – Customer Value (The “Who”)**
*Segments customers into value tiers: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze.*

### **Page 4 – Checkout (The “How”)**
*Examines customer habits in checkout patterns, payment preferences, and discount adoption.*

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

This analysis uncovered three critical insights that form the basis of our strategic recommendations:

| Insight | Finding | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Loyalty Key** | Subscribed customers are **33% more loyal** (avg. 33 previous purchases) than non-subscribers (avg. 22). | **Boost Subscriptions:** Aggressively market subscriptions to 'Silver' & 'Gold' tiers to build long-term loyalty. |
| **2. The Failed Strategy** | Discounts are **ineffective**. The data shows that applying a discount does *not* increase the average purchase amount. | **Optimize Discounts:** Stop ineffective flat discounts and re-allocate the budget to value-added bundles or a VIP program. |
| **3. The $6M Insight** | Not all customers are equal. **75% of revenue comes from 50% of customers** (the 'Platinum' & 'Gold' tiers). | **Launch a VIP Program:** Retaining these high-value customers is paramount. They are 6-7x more valuable than 'Bronze' customers. |

## ⚙️ Python Data Preparation Highlights

1.  **Loaded Dataset:** Imported `customer_shopping_behavior.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Cleaned Column Names:** Standardized all column names to `snake_case` for easier querying (e.g., `Purchase Amount (USD)` -> `purchase_amount`).
3.  **Handled Missing Data:** Checked for `null` values; no imputation was needed as the dataset was complete.
4.  **Engineered Feature (Value):** Created `customer_value_score` by multiplying `purchase_amount` * `previous_purchases` to quantify customer value.
5.  **Engineered Feature (Segment):** Created `customer_segment` ('Bronze', 'Silver', 'Gold', 'Platinum') by splitting the `customer_value_score` into 4 equal quartiles (25% each).
6.  **Handled Redundancy:** Performed a check to confirm `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` columns were identical.
7.  **Dropped Column:** Dropped the redundant `promo_code_used` column to clean the final dataset.
8.  **Saved Cleaned File:** Exported the fully prepped DataFrame to `cleaned_customer_shopping_behavior.csv` for use in Power BI and SQL analysis.
